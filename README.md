# Hi, I’m Dawson Fairbanks, PhD

I’m a bioinformatician and ecosystem scientist working at the intersection of microbial ecology, data science, and environmental impact. I currently lead sequencing and data workflows at [Funga](https://www.funga.earth), a climate biotech startup restoring forests using native fungal microbiomes 🌲🍄.

My work focuses on integrating genomic, ecological, and environmental data to scale nature-based climate solutions and forest carbon insights.
