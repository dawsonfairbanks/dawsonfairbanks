# Hi, I’m Dawson Fairbanks, PhD

I’m a bioinformatician and ecosystem scientist working at the intersection of microbial ecology, data science, and environmental impact. I currently lead sequencing and data workflows at [Funga](https://www.funga.earth), a climate biotech startup restoring forests using native fungal microbiomes 🌲🍄.

My work focuses on integrating genomic, ecological, and environmental data to scale nature-based climate solutions and forest carbon insights. I help scale with cloud infrastructure and am actively integrating ML to accelerate biodiversity and restoration analytics.

### 🔬 What I Do
- Build scalable, reproducible pipelines to process microbial sequencing data  
- Analyze soil biodiversity and functional traits across environmental gradients  
- Integrate genomic, geospatial, and ecological data for forest restoration and climate modeling  
- Collaborate across science, tech, and product teams to translate soil DNA into actionable insight  
- As one of Funga's first data science hires, I played a key role in designing Funga’s data infrastructure — including data modeling, ingest pipelines, and integration of forest inventory, soil, geospatial, hyperspectral and sequencing data into Databricks  
- Partnered with product and science leads to embed AI as a strategic layer in data workflows — from QC automation to biodiversity modeling and restoration outcome prediction
