# Hi, I’m Dawson Fairbanks, PhD

I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Arizona and the Principal Investigator of a Department of Energy CSP New Investigator Award analyzing soil metagenomic data 🧬.

### Some things about me
- 👀 I am interested in microbial ecolology, soil science and global change.
- 🌱 I am currently working on broad scale microbial synthesis efforts linking microbial traits across ecosystem and global scales. More information about this work can be found at our [NCEAS LTER EMERGENT working group web page](https://lternet.edu/working-groups/ecological-metagenome-derived-reference-genomes-and-traits-emergent/).
- 🔍 I am looking to collaborate on scaling soil properties to drive novel insight and create solutions to environmental problems. I am seeking roles where I can apply my training in ecosystem and data science to answer critical questions in environmental related fields.
